## About
Deep dream is a project that aims to replicate the effects of psychedelic drugs as seen in Google's Deep Dream code. This artificial neural network takes a novel image and turns it into an enhanced, or "trippy" one.

## How to use
Install Python version 3.12.4 with Anaconda. Ensure all dependencies are installed, including TensorFlow, NumPy, Pillow, urllib3, and ziptools. Once the code is pasted, insert your image path in the variable titled "image_path."

Note: The model is only capable of running on images of size 256x256 or less and in the jpg format.
